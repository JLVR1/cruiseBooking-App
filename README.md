# cruiseBooking-App
First year project at UWC

I was tasked with creating a cruise bookking app. I originally had a few ideas as to what i wanted the app to do
The main goal being an application that allows users to book a cruise and customize it to suit their personal needs
It is a very simple application that collects data and prints said data to a file specified in the code.
